Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm a _DevOps Engineer_ at _Sevenzon Technologies_ based out of _Uttar Pradesh, India_.

I'm well acquainted with various *DevOps tools* & *frontend development* as well as *cloud technologies*. I primarily code in **Python** and **Javascript**.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, socialise, photography, game, experience new things, explore neighborhoods through food and occasionally bring out my inner cinematographer. Also, did someone say road trip?
